There are three solutions here, among which two are the official

solutions proposed by Microsoft. Let me tell you right off -

Microsoft&#39;s solutions had no effect, so you might want to skip to

the last one immediately.

1. Deleting all IE settings so as to remove potentially blocking

add-ons.

2. Uninstalling and reinstalling IE completely.

3. Running a script that cleans your registry and re-registers

missing DLLs.
