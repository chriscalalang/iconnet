&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Blue Screen errors (also sometimes called black screen errors or STOP code errors) can occur if a serious problem causes Windows to shut down or restart unexpectedly. You might see a message that says, "Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer."
These errors can be caused by both hardware and software issues. If you added new hardware to your PC before the Blue Screen error, shut down your PC, remove the hardware, and try restarting. If you're having trouble restarting, you can start your PC in safe mode. For more info, see Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode).
You can also try getting the latest updates with Windows Update, help from other sources, or restoring Windows to an earlier point in time.

If these solutions don't solve the problem, you can get help from Microsoft Support and the Microsoft community. Microsoft Support offers technical help about different versions of Windows. The Microsoft community pages in the Windows forum offer solutions from other people who have experienced similar problems with their PCs.
If your PC came with Windows preinstalled on it, contact the PC manufacturer.

Restore Windows to an earlier point in time
You can restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point. System Restore doesnâ€™t change your personal files, but it might remove recently installed apps and drivers.
