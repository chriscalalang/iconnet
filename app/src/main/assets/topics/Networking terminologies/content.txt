•	RJ-45 - Standard connectors used for unshielded twisted-pair cable. Most commonly used with Cat5 network cabling.
 <br/>
•	Route - A path through an internetwork.
 <br/>
•	Router - A device that routes/forwards data across a networks.
 <br/>
•	Server - A computer that handles requests for data, email, files, and other network services from other computers (clients)
 <br/>
•	Subnet - A portion of a network that shares a common address component but is on a different segment than the rest of the network.
 <br/>
•	TI Line - A high speed dedicated data line that supports a transmission rate of 1.544 Mbps
 <br/>
•	TCP/IP - Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. A suite of protocols used as the basis of the nation's internetwork (Internet). It can also be used on internal networks.
 <br/>
•	UNC (Universal Naming Convention) Path - A UNC provides a naming convention for identifying network resources. UNC names consist of three parts, a server name, a share name, and an optional file path.
 <br/>
•	WAN (wide area network) - A network linking together networks located in other geographic areas.

 <br/>

•	Network Interface: A network interface can refer to any kind of software interface to networking hardware. For instance, if you have two network cards in your computer, you can control and configure each network interface associated with them individually.
 <br/>


•	Firewall: A firewall is a program that decides whether traffic coming into a server or going out should be allowed. A firewall usually works by creating rules for which type of traffic is acceptable on which ports. Generally, firewalls block ports that are not used by a specific application on a server.
 <br/>


•	Port: A port is an address on a single machine that can be tied to a specific piece of software. It is not a physical interface or location, but it allows your server to be able to communicate using more than one application.

 <br/>

•	VPN: VPN stands for virtual private network. It is a means of connecting separate LANs through the internet, while maintaining privacy. This is used as a means of connecting remote systems as if they were on a local network, often for security reasons.

 <br/>

•	VLAN - virtual LAN. Group of devices on one or more LANs that are configured (using management software) so that they can communicate as if they were attached to the same wire, when in fact they are located on a number of different LAN segments. Because VLANs are based on logical instead of physical connections, they are extremely flexible.
 <br/>
•	Jitter - Refers to the variation in Latency (see definition below). Jitter is important as often larger variations in the delay due to communications can negatively impact the 'deterministic' nature of the relevant system.
 <br/>
•	AAA - Authentication, authorization, and accounting. Pronounced "triple a.".
 <br/>
•	ACL - Access Control Lists are used for purposes filtering IP traffic generally for security reasons.
 <br/>
•	Cell/Area Zone - A logical section or subset (physical, geographical or function) of the production facility. It typically contains Level 0-2 devices.
 <br/>
•	Control Plane - Control plane refers to network protocol traffic (e.g. routing, resiliency) that usually passes between network infrastructure devices to maintain the network's functions. Examples of control plane traffic include Spanning Tree and EIGRP.
 <br/>
•	Data Plane - Data plane refers to the application data the network switches and routes being sent to and from end-devices. CIP is considered data plane traffic.
 <br/>
•	DMZ, Demilitarized Zone - Refers to a buffer or network segment between two network zones. A DMZ is commonly found between a corporate network and the internet where data and services can be shared/accessed from users in either the internet or corporate networks. A DMZ is typically established with network firewalls to manage and secure the traffic from either zone.
 <br/>
•	Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) - Refers to the set of devices and applications used to automate and control the relevant manufacturing process. Rather than use various terms with a similar meaning (e.g., production systems, factory floor systems, we standardized on this term for use in this paper). That is not to suggest any specific focus or limitations. We intend that the ideas and concepts outline herein are applicable in various types of manufacturing including but not limited to batch, continuous, discrete, hybrid and process. Other documents and industry references may refer to Industrial Control Systems (ICS). For the purpose of this document, those terms are interchangeable. This document simply choose to use IACS, as reflected in the ISA 99 standards.
 <br/>
•	IP Protocol Suite - Is a set of networking standards on which the internet and most enterprise networking is based. It includes the Layer 3 Internet Protocol (IP), the Layer-4 Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
 <br/>
•	IPSec - IP Security. A framework of open standards that provides data confidentiality, data integrity, and data authentication between participating peers. IPSec provides these security services at the IP layer. IPSec uses IKE (See above) to handle the negotiation of protocols and algorithms based on local policy and to generate the encryption and authentication keys to be used by IPSec. IPSec can protect one or more data flows between a pair of hosts, between a pair of security gateways, or between a security gateway and a host.
 <br/>
•	OSI Model - The Open Systems Interconnection model is a Network architectural model consisting of seven layers, each of which specifies particular network functions, such as addressing, flow control, error control, encapsulation, and reliable message transfer. The lowest layer (the physical layer) is closest to the media technology. The lower two layers are implemented in hardware and software whereas the upper five layers are implemented only in software. The highest layer (the application layer) is closest to the user. The OSI reference model is used universally as a method for teaching and understanding network functionality
 <br/>
The term layer in this document generally refers to a layer 	or layers of the OSI Model.
 <br/>
•	WINS - Windows Internet Naming Service. Microsoft's NetBIOS name translation service, analogous to DNS.
