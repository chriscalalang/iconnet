•	OSI Model - The Open Systems Interconnection model is a Network architectural model consisting of seven layers, each of which specifies particular network functions, such as addressing, flow control, error control, encapsulation, and reliable message transfer. The lowest layer (the physical layer) is closest to the media technology. The lower two layers are implemented in hardware and software whereas the upper five layers are implemented only in software. The highest layer (the application layer) is closest to the user. The OSI reference model is used universally as a method for teaching and understanding network functionality

The term layer in this document generally refers to a layer 	or layers of the OSI Model.

•	WINS - Windows Internet Naming Service. Microsoft's NetBIOS name translation service, analogous to DNS.
