A modem (modulator-demodulator) is a network hardware device that modulates one or more carrier wave signals to encode digital information for transmission and demodulates signals to decode the transmitted information. The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded to reproduce the original digital data
Function of the Modem
A modem is an external or internal device thats function is to transmit digital data over communication lines. Traditional modems once used frequently with dial-up networks convert analog data from telephone lines into computer digital data. Broadband modems transfer digital data between two digital devices.
How does modem work?
With frequency shift keying, a separate tone is used for separate bits. Once a terminal's modem dials up the computer's modem, the terminal's modem then becomes the originate modem and sends a 1,070-hertz tone for a 0 and a 1,270-hertz tone for a 1. The computer's modem is known as the answer modem and sends a 2,025-hertz tone for a 0 and a 2,225-hertz tone for a 1. Since the two modems send out different tones, they are able to use the lines at the same time, which is known as full-duplex operation.
To make modems faster, a technique that is more sophisticated than frequency shift keying had to be utilized. Phase-shift keying was the first new technique that was used along with quadrature amplitude modulation. Both of the new techniques make it possible for an immense amount of data to fit into the 3,000 hertz of bandwidth that is available on a regular voice-grade phone line.
