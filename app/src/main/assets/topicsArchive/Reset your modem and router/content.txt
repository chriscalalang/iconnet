The steps you take to reset the modem and router can vary, but here are the general steps:
1.	Unplug the power cable for the router from the wall.
2.	Unplug the power cable for the modem from the wall.
Some modems have a backup battery. So if you unplug the modem and lights stay on, remove the battery from the modem.
3.	Wait at least 30 seconds or so.
If you had to remove the battery from the modem, put it back in.
4.	Plug the modem back into the wall. The lights on the modem will blink. Wait for them to stop blinking.
5.	Plug your router back into the wall.
Wait a few minutes for the modem and router to fully power on. You can usually tell when they're ready by looking at the status lights on the two devices.
6.	On your PC, try to connect to the Wi-Fi network again.
