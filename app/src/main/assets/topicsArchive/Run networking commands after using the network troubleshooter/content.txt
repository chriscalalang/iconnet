The Network troubleshooter (mentioned above) can help diagnose and fix common connection problems. After using that, try running the network commands below because the combination of doing these two things can help you get connected.
If your problem isn't fixed after running the Network troubleshooter, try to:
    -	Reset the TCP/IP stack.
    -	Release the IP address.
    -	Renew the IP address.
    -	Flush and reset the DNS client resolver cache.
To run these networking commands in a command prompt window
    1.	Select the Start button, start typing cmd, right-click Command Prompt in the list, select Run as Administrator, and then select Yes.
    2.	At the command prompt, run the following commands in the listed order and then check to see if that fixes your connection problem:
        o	Type netsh winsock reset and press Enter.
        o	Type netsh int ip reset and press Enter.
        o	Type ipconfig /release and press Enter.
        o	Type ipconfig /renew and press Enter.
        o	Type ipconfig /flushdns and press Enter.
If Windows can't find a new driver for your network adapter, visit the PC manufacturer's website and download the latest network adapter driver from there. If your PC can't connect to the Internet, you'll need to download a driver on a different PC and save it to a USB flash drive so you can install the driver on your PC. You'll need to know the PC manufacturer and model name or number.
