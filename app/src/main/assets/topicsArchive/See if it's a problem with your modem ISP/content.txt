1.	Select the Start button, start typing cmd, right-click Command Prompt in the list, select Run as Administrator, and then select yes.
2.	At the command prompt, type ipconfig.
Look for the IP address listed next to Default gateway. Write down that address if you need to. For example, 192.168.1.1.
3.	At the prompt, type ping <Default gateway> and press Enter. For example, type ping 192.168.1.1 and press Enter.
